This is a program called Minesweeper. 
You are given an N by M matrix from the input, in which the cells contain single
characters – either a . (dot) or a ! (exclamation mark) – representing "empty" or "mined" positions.
The written program prints an N by M matrix, where each cell contains a number, representing how many adjacent
cells, including itself, are "mined".
Each cell in a matrix has at most 8 adjacent cells – the cells directly above, below, to the left, to the right, as those
diagonally – to the left and above, to the right and above, to the right and below and to the left and below.

This is an exercise in address arithmetic.
